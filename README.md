UPDATE: Automatic dependency installation is now available!<br>
**Windows**: The dependency installer will automatically install npm, GitHub Copilot CLI, Java and DotNet SDK 9.0<br>
**Linux**: The dependency installer will automatically install .NET SDK 9.0 using Wine (Wine must be installed separately)<br>
<br>
AI model used: Claude Sonnet 4.5 (Premium)<br>
<br>
<b>Please note: <br>
Each run costs 1 GitHub Copliot Plus premium credit.<br>
If a run fails, there will be upt to 10 retries, which can cost up to 10 GitHub Copilot Plus premium credits. This shouldn't happen normaly and is just a fallback mechanism.<br>
Each finetuning will cost 1 more credit, thus it is advised to note all changes required and let the AI perform them in one run.<br><br>
Vibe Coding Assistant is still a beta. It can eventually destroy an existing codebase.<br>
The generated code can be prone to errors and may contain security flaws. <br>
Don't use in a production environment!

```bash
npm install -g @github/copilot-cli
```

#### Authenticate with GitHub

Run the following command and follow the authentication flow:

```bash
github-copilot-cli
then enter /auth in the Github Copilot CLI prompt
```

This will:
1. Open your browser to authenticate with GitHub
2. Link your GitHub account with the CLI
3. Verify your GitHub Copilot Pro subscription

Verify installation:
```bash
github-copilot-cli --version
```

**Note:** GitHub Copilot CLI requires an active GitHub Copilot Pro subscription.

### First-Time Authentication

When you first launch Vibe Coding Assistant, if the GitHub Copilot CLI is not authenticated, you'll see an authentication dialog with the following options:

1. **Register for GitHub Copilot** ‚Äì Click the "Register..." link to open the GitHub Copilot subscription page in your browser
   - If your browser doesn't open automatically, the URL will be displayed in a dialog
   - You can also find the URL in the console output
   
2. **Launch Authentication** ‚Äì Click "Launch GitHub Copilot CLI to Authenticate" to start the authentication process
   - This opens a terminal session with the Copilot CLI
   - Enter `/login` in the CLI prompt
   - Follow the browser-based authentication flow
   - After successful authentication, restart Vibe Coding Assistant

**Troubleshooting Authentication:**
- The application uses multiple methods to open browsers (Java Desktop API, Windows `rundll32`, macOS `open`, Linux `xdg-open`)
- If automatic browser opening fails, copy the URL from the dialog or console
- Check that your default browser is properly configured
- Corporate or security policies may prevent automatic browser launching

## üß≠ Overview

The wizard walks you through three conversational screens to capture context about your codebase, intended changes, and environment. It then assembles a rich Copilot prompt, drives the Copilot CLI, and executes the resulting plan while tracking logs, compilation output, and retries inside a single window.

Use it when you want a repeatable way to generate new components or applications from structured requirements.

## üîß Core Functions

- **Project intake & validation** ‚Äì verify language, project style, and environment prerequisites before any work begins.
- **Prompt composition** ‚Äì combines task metadata, custom dialogs, and recent outcomes into a reproducible Copilot request.
- **Automated test generation** ‚Äì creates comprehensive unit tests and integration tests for all generated or modified code.
- **Build automation** ‚Äì chooses the correct build tool (Gradle, Maven, dotnet, cmake, python, custom script) and executes it.
- **Test execution** ‚Äì automatically runs unit tests and integration tests after building to verify code quality.
- **Self-healing loop** ‚Äì captures compiler output, feeds it back into Copilot, and limits retries to protect your workflow time.
- **Knowledge capture** ‚Äì Dialog editors let you curate workflows, task templates, and form layouts for your team.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Using the Wizard

1. **Initial Setup** ‚Äì Confirm runtime specifics (language, project style, operating systems). The wizard validates your selections and surfaces missing prerequisites.
2. **Task Selection** ‚Äì Pick from curated task categories (create app, modify code, fix build, author documentation, etc.) or load a saved dialog definition.
3. **Configure Details** ‚Äì Supply requirements in structured forms. Multi-line editors help you capture acceptance criteria, code snippets, and notes.
4. **Run & Monitor** ‚Äì Watch the live console for Copilot responses, command execution, and build logs. You can pause or stop the workflow at any time.
5. **Automated Testing** ‚Äì The wizard automatically generates unit tests and integration tests for all code, then executes them to verify correctness.
6. **Resolve Issues** ‚Äì Use the compilation error dialog to inspect remaining problems and retry with refined instructions if the automated loop exhausts its attempts.

## üß™ Testing Features

The Vibe Coding Assistant automatically creates and executes tests for all generated or modified code:

- **Unit Tests** ‚Äì Tests individual functions, methods, and classes in isolation
  - Covers normal use cases, edge cases, and error conditions
  - Uses appropriate testing frameworks (JUnit, NUnit/xUnit, pytest, Jest, etc.)
  - Aims for 80%+ code coverage of critical paths
  
- **Integration Tests** ‚Äì Tests interactions between components (when applicable)
  - Verifies end-to-end workflows and user scenarios
  - Tests database operations, file I/O, and API calls
  - Validates that integrated components work together correctly

- **Automatic Execution** ‚Äì After building, all tests are run automatically
  - Unit tests run first to verify individual components
  - Integration tests run second to verify component interactions
  - Build fails if tests don't pass, triggering the self-healing loop

- **Framework Support** ‚Äì Works with standard test commands:
  - Java/Gradle: `gradle test`
  - Java/Maven: `mvn test`
  - C#/.NET: `dotnet test`
  - Python: `pytest`
  - JavaScript/Node: `npm test`


## ÔøΩÔ∏è Database Support

Vibe Coding Assistant includes first-class database support to help you generate database-aware applications with proper ORM integration and migrations.

### Configuring Database Support

1. **Open Project Settings** from the File menu or toolbar
2. Navigate to the **Database** tab
3. Configure two settings:

#### Database System Description
Describe the database system you're using (e.g., "PostgreSQL 15", "MySQL 8.0", "SQLite 3.40"). Include version information and any relevant connection details like host, port, and database name. This information helps the AI generate appropriate connection code.

**Example:**
```
PostgreSQL 15 on localhost:5432, database: myapp_db
```

#### Database Definition File
Attach a schema definition file that describes your database structure. Supported formats:
- **SQL DDL files** (`.sql`) - CREATE TABLE statements
- **CSV files** (`.csv`) - Simple table/column listings

**SQL Example:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    username VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE orders (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    user_id INT NOT NULL,
    total DECIMAL(10,2),
    status VARCHAR(50),
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id)
);
```

**CSV Example:**
```
users
id
email
username
created_at

orders
id
user_id
total
status
```

### Using Database Tokens in Prompts

Reference specific tables and fields in your prompts using token syntax:

- **`{TABLE}`** - References an entire table
- **`{TABLE.FIELD}`** - References a specific column in a table

**Examples:**
- "Create CRUD endpoints for {users}"
- "Add validation to ensure {users.email} is unique"
- "Generate a report joining {users} and {orders} on {orders.user_id}"

The system will:
1. ‚úÖ Validate tokens against your schema
2. ‚ö†Ô∏è Warn about invalid table or field references
3. üí° Suggest similar table names if you mistype
4. üìã Include relevant schema context in AI requests

### ORM and Migration Support

Based on your programming language, the AI will automatically:

- **Java**: Use JPA/Hibernate with proper entity annotations, generate Flyway or Liquibase migrations
- **C#**: Use Entity Framework Core with DbContext, generate EF Core migrations
- **Python**: Use SQLAlchemy with declarative models, generate Alembic migrations
- **JavaScript**: Use Prisma, TypeORM, or Sequelize with appropriate schema definitions
- **Ruby**: Use ActiveRecord with Rails conventions and migrations
- **PHP**: Use Doctrine or Eloquent with migration files
- **Go**: Use GORM or sqlx with struct tags and migrations

The generated code will:
- Define database models using idiomatic ORMs for the target language
- Include migration files to version schema changes
- Wire database connections using settings from "Database Description"
- Follow security best practices (no hardcoded credentials)

### Security Note

‚ö†Ô∏è The "Database Description" field is used for generating connection code. **NEVER include passwords or sensitive credentials directly.** Instead, reference environment variables or secure configuration methods in your description:

```
PostgreSQL 15 on ${DB_HOST}:${DB_PORT}
Database: ${DB_NAME}
Use environment variables for credentials
```

## üöÄ Setup & Launch

### Option A: Run with Gradle (requires Gradle 8+)

1. Install a compatible Gradle distribution or add the Gradle Wrapper.
2. From the project root run:
   - `gradle run` to launch the wizard.
   - `gradle jar` to produce `build/libs/vibe-coding-wizard.jar` for later use.

### Option B: Manual compilation with `javac`

1. Create an output directory: `mkdir -p out`.
2. Compile sources: `javac -d out (find src/main/java -name "*.java")`.
3. Start the app: `java -cp out com.vibecoding.wizard.VibeCodingWizardApp`.

> Prefer a single runnable artifact? After `gradle jar`, launch with `java -jar build/libs/vibe-coding-wizard.jar`.

## ÔøΩÔ∏è Customization & Extensibility

- Tailor prompt phrasing in `PromptBuilder.java` to match your team‚Äôs tone or templates.
- Extend `BuildCommandPlanner.java` to support new languages, test runners, or deployment hooks.
- Integrate with alternative CLIs by swapping out `CopilotCliService.java`.
- Adjust theming and layout via `ThemeManager.java`, `UiUtils.java`, and `FormLayoutBuilder.java`.

## üß™ Development Notes

- Run unit tests with `gradle test` (requires Gradle and JDK 21+).
- Headless UI tests live under `src/test/java/com/vibecoding/wizard/tests/` and can be executed the same way.
- The application builds cleanly without external dependencies; ensure your `JAVA_HOME` matches the required toolchain version.

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

- **Copilot CLI not found:** Run `npm install -g @github/copilot` and verify the binary is on your `PATH`.
- **Copilot CLI not authenticated:** When the authentication dialog appears, click "Launch GitHub Copilot CLI to Authenticate" and follow the browser-based authentication flow. After completing authentication, restart the application.
- **"Register..." link doesn't open browser:** 
  - The application tries multiple methods to open your browser (Java Desktop API, OS-specific commands)
  - If automatic opening fails, a dialog will display the URL to manually copy: `https://github.com/features/copilot`
  - On Windows, ensure your default browser is properly configured in Windows settings
  - Check console output for detailed debugging information about browser opening attempts
  - If you're in a restricted environment (corporate policy, antivirus, etc.), you may need to manually open the URL
- **Build command fails immediately:** Check that the detected project style matches a configured build tool; override defaults in the wizard if needed. Make sure that the build tools required for the chosen programing language are installed.
- **UI fails to start:** Confirm you compiled with a compatible JDK and that Swing is available (it ships with the standard JDK).
- **Retry loop stops early:** The wizard caps retries at 10 iterations to avoid infinite paths. Adjust logic in `TaskExecutionDialog.java` if you need different limits.
